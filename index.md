# About Me

Here is **Hairong Ni**.

I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science** at the **University of Michigan**, and I am also pursuing a **dual degree in Mechanical Engineering** at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**.

I am currently a member of the **[Deep Think Lab](https://deepthink-umich.github.io/people.html)** at the University of Michigan, where I am fortunate to be advised by **Prof. Qu Qing**. My current research focuses on **diffusion model generalization** and **multimodal hypothesis generation**.

Previously, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I was a member of the **[Intelligent Big Data Systems Group (IBDSys)](https://ibdsys.sjtu.edu.cn)**, where I worked on topics related to **AI for Networks**.

I am broadly interested in machine learning, generative models, and multimodality, and I am actively seeking research internships for Spring or Summer 2026.  
My CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VQyFZgRzju6FHwvlhRYeBGbXhyR1NMB/view).
